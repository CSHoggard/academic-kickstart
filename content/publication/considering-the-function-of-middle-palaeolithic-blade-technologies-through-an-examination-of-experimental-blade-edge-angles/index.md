abstract: Over the last three decades a number of archaeological investigations
  have demonstrated the widespread use of both laminar and Levallois methods of
  blade manufacture throughout the European Middle Palaeolithic. These
  strategies are observed in varying quantities in both Early and Late Middle
  Palaeolithic contexts, and have been documented in a number of archaeological
  horizons concurrently and in isolation of one another. However, despite their
  (co-)occurrence investigations have not considered the potential practical
  benefits of either blade strategy, and the actual functionality of these blade
  manufacturing techniques. Using an experimental dataset, this article
  investigates differences in the function of both strategies through a
  consideration of their edge angle, an important functional attribute of lithic
  artefacts. A null hypothesis of ‘no difference’ was examined through a
  statistical framework to assess the degree of variance between both blade
  strategies. Analyses demonstrate considerable difference in both the
  distribution of edge angles produced, and the mean edge angle values observed.
  Through the analytical framework it can be demonstrated that both blade
  production methods would have provided distinct differences for past hominin
  populations, with respect to their microfracturing properties and attrition
  rate. However, when reviewed against other edge angle analyses, against a
  functional backdrop, their edge angle in isolation cannot explain their
  appearance and subsequent use. Further work considering the functional
  attributes of these blade strategies is now important in conjunction with
  technological analysis to assess the role of artefact design during the Middle
  Palaeolithic, and the different ‘potentials’ of both blade manufacturing
  techniques to past hominin populations.
