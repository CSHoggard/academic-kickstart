abstract: In this article we demonstrate, using two archaeological case studies,
  the applicability and potential of geometric morphometric methodologies to the
  Danish archaeological record. The article first introduces the reader to the
  mathematical underpinnings of statistical shape and form (shape plus size)
  analysis, before detailing the fundamentals of geometric morphometrics,
  emphasising its statistical power and coverage in comparison to linear
  morphometrics. Throughout this article, we detail the workflow, from data
  acquisition and through to subsequent analysis. We emphasise open-source
  software packages which can be used in conducting shape analysis, and the
  wealth of information available on this subject. While a high degree of
  technical knowledge is necessary, an incredible amount of analytical
  possibility can be harnessed through the adoption of two- and
  three-dimensional geometric morphometrics.
