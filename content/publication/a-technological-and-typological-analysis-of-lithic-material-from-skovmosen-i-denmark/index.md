abstract: During road construction work, material attributed to the Final
  Palaeolithic was discovered at Skovmosen I, near Kongens Lyngby on Zealand,
  eastern Denmark. Although it is regularly mentioned in reviews of the southern
  Scandinavian Final Palaeolithic, the Skovmosen I assemblage has hitherto
  remained poorly described. We here review the site’s discovery history and its
  context. Aided by a three-dimensional digital recording protocol, this article
  details the assemblage composition and its technology. The assemblage is
  comprised of tanged points, scrapers and burins, alongside blades and cores as
  primary reduction products. Although evidently disturbed by the road
  construction that led to the site’s discovery, the material likely reflects
  the remains of a small Final Palaeolithic locale, where diverse activities
  were carried out.
