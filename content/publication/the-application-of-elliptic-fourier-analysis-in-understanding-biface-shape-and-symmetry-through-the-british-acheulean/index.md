abstract: Acheulean biface shape and symmetry have fuelled many discussions on
  past hominin behaviour in regards to the ‘meaning’ of biface technology.
  However, few studies have attempted to quantify and investigate their
  diachronic relationship using a substantial dataset of Acheulean bifaces.
  Using the British archaeological record as a case study, we first perform
  elliptic Fourier analysis on biface outlines to quantify and better understand
  the relationship between biface shape and individual interglacial periods.
  Using the extracted Fourier coefficients, we then detail the nature of
  symmetry throughout this period, before investigating both shape and symmetry
  in parallel. The importance of size (through biface length) as a factor in
  biface shape and symmetry is also considered. Results highlight high levels of
  symmetry from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13, followed by increasing asymmetry
  through the British Acheulean. Other observations include a general shift to
  ‘pointed’ forms during MIS 9 and 7 and the importance of size in high biface
  symmetry levels. This article concludes by discussing the potential importance
  of secondary deposition and palimpsest sites in skewing the observed
  relationships throughout the Palaeolithic.
