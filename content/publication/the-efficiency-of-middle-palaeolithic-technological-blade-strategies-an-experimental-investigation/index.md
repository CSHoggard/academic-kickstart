abstract: "We present an experimental study that considers the Middle
  Palaeolithic transition from an earlier, predominantly Levallois method of
  blade production, to a later, predominantly laminar method, and why at some
  sites they even co-occur. This paper explores the nature of this
  spatio-temporal diversity by investigating a possible functional explanation:
  in this case, the amount of cutting edge per artefact, and cutting edge per
  weight of raw material. While there have been studies that examine laminar
  blade cutting edge, and Levallois flake cutting edge more generally, studies
  have not compared these two strategies through the same experimental
  framework. This study also uses a hard hammer (direct hard stone) percussive
  method to produce the experimental dataset (the only attested percussive
  method for blade production used in the Middle Palaeolithic), a method that
  has not been employed in experimental studies thus far. Results show that the
  amount of cutting edge does not differ significantly between Levallois and
  laminar blades. However, analyses suggest that laminar-based strategies were
  able to produce larger numbers of smaller blade products, and that a decrease
  in blade size was associated with greater cutting edge per weight of blade.
  Future studies comparing these techniques in terms of their economisation of
  raw material, which analyse the entire production sequence, are recommended in
  order to further explore the difference in blade production strategy as a
  choice guided by raw material economisation."
