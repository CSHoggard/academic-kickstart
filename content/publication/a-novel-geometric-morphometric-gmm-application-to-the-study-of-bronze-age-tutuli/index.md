abstract: In this paper, we examine the morphological diversity of the tutuli
  object group from the earlier Nordic Bronze Age (henceforth NBA) – an often
  over-looked object group despite their abundance specially, temporally and
  contextually. Currently, only a few studies of the morphological diversity of
  tutuli have been published, and these consist primarily of
  decade-old-typologies. The objective of this of this paper is first and
  foremost methodological, as we examine two research questions – concerning
  classification and periodisation – through a novel two-dimensional geometric
  morphometric (henceforth GMM) framework and subsequent multivariate analysis.
  Inherently we examine whether specific shapes conform to the classificatory of
  the Montelius typology, and whether a temporal relationship exists between
  types and shapes.
