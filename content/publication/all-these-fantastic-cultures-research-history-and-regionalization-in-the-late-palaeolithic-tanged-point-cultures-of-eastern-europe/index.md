abstract: The Late Glacial, that is the period from the first pronounced warming
  after the Last GlacialMaximum to the beginning of the Holocene (c.
  16,000–11,700 calBP), is traditionally viewed as atime when northern Europe
  was being recolonized and Late Palaeolithic cultures diversified.
  Thesecultures are characterized by particular artefact types, or the
  co-occurrence or specific relative frequenciesof these. In north-eastern
  Europe, numerous cultures have been proposed on the basis of
  supposedlydifferent tanged points. This practice of naming new cultural units
  based on these perceived differenceshas been repeatedly critiqued, but robust
  alternatives have rarely been offered. Here, we review thetaxonomic landscape
  of Late Palaeolithic large tanged point cultures in eastern Europe as
  currentlyenvisaged, which leads us to be cautious about the epistemological
  validity of many of the constituentgroups. This, in turn, motivates us to
  investigate the key artefact class, the large tanged point, usinggeometric
  morphometric methods. Using these methods, we show that distinct groups are
  difficult torecognize, with major implications for our understanding of
  patterns and processes of culture change inthis period in north-eastern Europe
  and perhaps elsewhere.
