abstract: The analysis of ancient genomes is having a major impact on
  archaeological interpretations. Yet, the methodological divide between these
  disciplines is substantial. Fundamentally, there is an urgent need to
  reconcile archaeological and genetic taxonomies. However, traditional
  archaeological taxonomies are problematic because they are epistemologically
  weak and often laden with undue assumptions about past ethnicity and
  demographyâ€”they are a hindrance rather than a help in such a reconciliation.
  Eisenmann and colleagues have recently tackled this issue, offering a palette
  of potential solutions that circumvents traditional archaeological culture
  labels. We welcome renewed attention to nomenclature but take issue with such
  recent work that favours systems of taxonomic assignment for genomic groups
  that either do not include archaeological information at all or retain
  traditional cultural taxonomic categories. While superficially pragmatic,
  these administrative solutions do not address the substantive issues that the
  topic raises. We here present the argument that the only analytically viable
  solution to aligning genetic and cultural nomenclature is to conceptualise
  material culture as underwritten by a system of information transmission
  across generations that has similar structural properties to the genetic
  system of information transmission. This alignment facilitates the use of
  similar analytical protocols and hence allows for a true parallel analysis.
  Once culture change is also understood as an evolutionary process, a wealth of
  analytical methods for reconciling archaeological and genetic clusters becomes
  available.
