abstract: The retouching and resharpening of lithic tools during their
  production and maintenance leads to the production of large numbers of small
  flakes and chips known as microdebitage. Standard analytical approaches to
  this material involves the mapping of microartefact densities to identify
  activity areas, and the creation of techno-typologies to characterise the form
  of retouch flakes from different types of tools. Whilst use-wear analysis is a
  common approach to the analysis of tools, it has been applied much less
  commonly to microdebitage. This paper contends that the use-wear analysis of
  microdebitage holds great potential for identifying activity areas on
  archaeological sites, representing a relatively unexplored analytical resource
  within microartefact assemblages. In order to test the range of factors that
  affect the identification of use-wear traces on small retouch flakes, a blind
  test consisting of 40 retouch flakes was conducted. The results show that wear
  traces can be identified with comparable levels of accuracy to those reported
  for historic blind tests of standard lithic tools suggesting that the use-wear
  analysis of retouch flakes can be a useful analytical tool in understanding
  site function, and in increasing sample sizes in cases where assemblages
  contain few tools.
