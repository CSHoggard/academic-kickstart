abstract: While there have been many surveys of archaeologists in the UK (for
  example – Aitchison 1997; Aitchison and Edwards 2003; Aitchison and Edwards
  2008, Aitchison and Rocks- Macqueen 2013) and indeed in many other countries
  (see DISCO projects for examples of from dozens of European countries
  www.discovering-archaeologists.eu/) there have been limited surveys into what
  archaeologists’ views are on public engagement. There was one survey of
  ‘Attitudes and Values in Archaeological Practice’ (Zimmer et al. 1995) that
  asked some questions on the topic and another survey that specifically
  targeted the views of archaeologists in New Mexico (Rocks-Macqueen 2012).
  These aside, there is a significant gap in our understanding of how
  archaeologists perceive their engagement with the public. This Paper aims to
  help bridge that gap and provide data on how public engagement is perceived by
  archaeologists in the UK.
